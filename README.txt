Plugin Builder Results

Your plugin Hydrology was created in:
    /Volumes/T7 Shield/plugin_hydro/plugin/test/pino/pippo/hydrological_analysis

Your QGIS plugin directory is located at:
    /Users/giuseppecosentino/Library/Application Support/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins

What's Next:

  * Copy the entire directory containing your new plugin to the QGIS plugin
    directory

  * Run the tests (``make test``)

  * Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager

  * Customize it by editing the implementation file: ``hydrological_analysis.py``

  * You can use the Makefile to compile your Ui and resource files when
    you make changes. This requires GNU make (gmake)
